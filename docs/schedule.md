The tutorial is on __Monday, September 09__ starting at __14:00__ in room __Zeta 2__. The speakers will be available afterwards for Q&A, and questions are always welcome on the [_aeon_](/https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/) Slack (details on the website).

- Introduction to Time Series Machine Learning and _aeon_ - (14:00, 10 Minutes, by Anthony Bagnall)

  Special considerations must be given when it comes to processing and creating models from time series data. To begin we will be a brief overview of the time series data and the different kinds of time series data one may find. We will also briefly introduce the _aeon_ toolkit, which is used in our code examples.

- Classification and Regression - (14:10, 30 Minutes, by Matthew Middlehurst)

  Time series classification (TSC) and regression (TSER) are rapidly evolving fields that find areas of application in many domains.These will be among the more familiar tasks to those with knowledge of vector-based machine learning. We showcase the types of algorithms used for TSC and TSER, and how they learn from large variety of characteristics found in datasets of time series.
